          <h1>Hi, I'm Jason Anderson.</h1>

          <p>---</p>

          <h2>TL;DR</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a FinTech leader, currently focused compliance tech
            for SMB Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisors.
            I'm working on a new project, building 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://forumhq.com">Forum HQ</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Background</h2>

          <p>
            After graduating college in 2010, I joined the old-school municipal bond
            dealer
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roosevelt-cross.com/"
              >Roosevelt and Cross</a>. My day job was to trade and sell muni's, but
              I became intersted in understanding the inner workings of
              these heavily regulated entities.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, I joined
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://fortune.com/2017/05/16/neighborly-public-finance/"
              >Neighborly</a
            >, where I opened our New York office, launched a new Broker-Dealer and
            built a municipal bond investment platform. Our technology on-boarded tens
            of city and state government partners and transacted over $100 million of
            securities to individual investors. I encountered first-hand the challenges
            of building financial services infrastructure with the scalability of a 
            tech start up.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2019, I joined a small team at
            <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://addepar.com"
            >Addepar</a
            >, to help incubate 
            <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://addepar.com/blog/introducing-marketplace">Marketplace</a
            >, a new business unit (the first one at Addepar) 
            that leverages Addepar's data and client base to deliver targeted analytics, 
            access to financial products, and digital execution to existing clients. In
            this effort, we launched a
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/298058"
              >Broker-Dealer</a
            >
            where I served as COO, and an
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/317152"
              >Investment Advisor</a
            >.
          <p>
            After standing up two BDs and an RIA, I started to feel the weight of repeat frustration,
            which were primarily rooted in vendor offerings in operations and compliance. This led me to
            create
            <a 
              target="_blank" href="https://forumhq.com"
              >Forum HQ</a
            >.
            Our team is working to develop simple technology to help small- and medium-sized
            broker-dealers, investment advisors, and funds automate the day-to-day tasks that are necessary,
            but often get in the way of running their business and serving their customers. We believe that
            the increasing regulatory burden is putting harmful pressure on the 91% of these companies which
            are considered to be SMB, which is driving consolidation, or worse. The health of the financial
            services business relies on a wide variety of firm shapes and sizes, and we want to be a part of 
            holding it together.
